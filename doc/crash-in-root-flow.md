# Crash in the root flow
 
This use case occurs when 
* an error occurs before the `Express` web application is started listening on HTTP request (E.g. in the `server.initalize()`)
* and you omit to handle the exception

Update the `worker.ts`

```typescript
export class WorkerProcess {
    // ...
    run(): void {
       this.initialize();
        // ...
    }
    private initialize() : void {
        throw new Error('Unexpected error occurs !');
    }
}
```

If you run this, 

* the worker process crashes
* the master process detects it (`code:1, signal:null, exitedAfterDisconnect:false`) and forks a new worker process. 

* But the master should add some logic to avoid to refork the worker indefinitively. E.g. 10 times in a certain amount of time, report a critical error)
* Or the worker should add a `try/cacth` block. And if the catched error is identified as fatal, it exit the process with a certain error code (E.g.99). The master process will treated as a fatal error and not restart the process

Update the `worker.ts` 

```typescript
private initialize() : void {
    try {
        throw new Error('Unexpected error occurs !');
    } catch(errr) {
        process.exit(99);
    }
}       
```

Update the `master.ts`

```typescript
 run(): void {
    cluster.on('exit', (worker: Worker, code: any, signal: any) => {
        // ...
      if (code !== 0 && !worker.exitedAfterDisconnect) {
        if (code === 99) {
          console.log(`${this.getMasterText(worker)} reports a fatal error and will not be restarted)`)
        } else {
          this.forkWorker();
        }
      } else {
        console.log(`${this.getMasterText(worker)} has exit successfully`)
      }
      
      if( this._workers.length === O) {
        console.log(`all workers processes have reported fatal erros and cannot be restarted`);
        process.exit(99);
      }
      this.displayWorkerCache();
    });
  }
```

This should generate the following output on the console
